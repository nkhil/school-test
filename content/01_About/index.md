---

St. Michael’s school is set in the idyllic countryside of Ahmednagar, a tier 2 city in the largest district of Maharashtra. The campus is spread over 6 acres of fresh open land with over 10 acres set aside for future expansion. With ample room to learn and reach their full potential in the crisp, clean outdoors, the students’ smiling faces are often the entire introduction you need.

## Mission

Our aim is to partner with the parents and guardians to provide quality education within a secure and caring environment. Together we strive to enable the children in St. Michael’s to reach their full potential. Our ultimate aim of imparting education is to create empowered knowledge and therefore empowered people.

Our mission is to ensure that the students who leave the portals of our school grow up to be fine young adults who will contribute constructively to society and be productive, intelligent citizens in our nation, India.

## Vision

In the years to come, we will be able to see the further growth of this institution in ways that will be of direct and visible benefit to the nation. We will be able to introduce and impart training of such a type and quality, that it will not only enable our alumni to work and progress towards their own goals in life, but also channel their abilities, privilege and energies in ways which will benefit those who are less fortunate. Such young people are the need of the hour in our country. To facilitate the creation of a cadre of future leaders and entrepreneurs who can give back to society, is our vision for this institution and our dream for its future.
